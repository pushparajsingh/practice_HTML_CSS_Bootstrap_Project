                        Datta, was born in an affluent family in Kolkata on <b>12 January 1863</b>. His father,
                        Vishwanath Datta, was a successful attorney with interests in a wide range of subjects, and his
                        mother, Bhuvaneshwari Devi, was endowed with deep devotion, strong character and other
                        qualities. A precocious boy, Narendra excelled in music, gymnastics and studies. By the time he
                        graduated from Calcutta University, he had acquired a vast knowledge of different subjects,
                        especially Western philosophy and history. Born with a yogic temperament, he used to practise
                        meditation even from his boyhood, and was associated with Brahmo Movement for some time.</p>
                    <h1 class="text-warning">With Sri Ramakrishna</h1>
                    <p class="text-light"> At the threshold of youth Narendra had to pass through a period of spiritual
                        crisis when he was assailed by doubts about the existence of God. It was at that time he first
                        heard about Sri Ramakrishna from one of his English professors at college. One day in November
                        1881, Narendra went to meet Sri Ramakrishna who was staying at the Kali Temple in Dakshineshwar.
                        He straightaway asked the Master a question which he had put to several others but had received
                        no satisfactory answer: “Sir, have you seen God?” Without a moment’s hesitation, Sri Ramakrishna
                        replied: “Yes, I have. I see Him as clearly as I see you, only in a much intenser sense.”</p>

                                Swami Vivekananda was a great social reformer and a very inspiring personality of India.

                                January 1863 to Vishwanath Datta and Bhuvaneshwari Devi. His father was a successful

                                One of the most prominent religious figures of India during the nineteenth
                                century,<strong> Sri Ramakrishna Paramhansa</strong> was a mystic and a yogi who
                                translated complex spiritual concepts into lucid and easily intelligible manner. Born in
                                a simple Bengali rural family in 1836, Ramakrishna was as simple yogi. He pursued the
                                Divine throughout his life in various forms and believed in divine embodiment of the
                                Supreme Being in every individual. Sometimes believed to be the modern day reincarnation
                                of Lord Vishnu, Ramakrishna was the embodiment of spiritual salvation to troubled souls
                                from all walks of life. He was a key figure in revival of Hinduism in Bengal at a time
                                when intense spiritual crisis was gripping the province leading to predominance of young
                                Bengalis embracing Brahmoism and Christianity. His legacy did not end with his death in
                                1886; his most prominent disciple Swami Vivekananda carried on his teachings and
                                philosophy to the world through Ramakrishna Mission. In essence, his teachings were as
                                traditional as ancient sages and seer, yet he remains contemporary throughout the ages.

                                Early Life

                                Ramakrishna was born as Gadadhar Chattopadhyay on February 18, 1836 to Khudiram
                                Chattopadhyay and Chandramani Devi. The poor Brahmin family hailed from the Kamarpukur
                                village of Hoogly district in Bengal Presidency.

                                Young Gadadhar was sent to the village school to learn Sanskrit, but a reluctant student
                                he would often play truant. He loved to paint and create clay models of Hindu Gods and
                                Goddesses. He was attracted to folk and mythological stories which he had heard from his
                                mother. He gradually leant Ramayana, Mahabharata, Puranas and other holy literature by
                                heart just by hearing it from priests and sages. Young Gadadhar loved the nature so much
                                that he used to spend much of his time in orchards and on the river-banks.

                                From a very young age, Gadadhar was religiously inclined and he would experience
                                episodes of spiritual ecstasy from everyday incidents. He would go into trances while
                                performing pujas or observing a religious drama.

                                After the death of Gadadhar’s father in 1843, the responsibility of the family fell on
                                his elder brother, Ramkumar. Ramkumar left home for Calcutta to earn for the family and
                                Gadadhar, back in his village started performing regular worshipping of their
                                family-deity, previously handled by his brother. He was deeply religious and would
                                perform the pujas ardently. Meanwhile, his elder brother had opened a school to teach
                                Sanskrit in Calcutta and served as a priest at different socio-religious functions.

                                Ramakrishna was married to five-year old Saradamoni Mukhopadhyay from a neighbouring
                                village when he was twenty three years of age in 1859. The couple stayed apart until
                                Saradamoni came of age and she joined her husband at Dakshineshwar at the age of
                                eighteen. Ramakrishna proclaimed her as the embodiment of Divine Mother and performed
                                the Shodashi Puja with her in the seat of Goddess Kali. She was an ardent follower of
                                her husband’s philosophies and took up the role of mother to his disciples with much
                                ease.

                                Sarada Devi (Bengali: সারদা দেবী; audio speaker iconSharodā Debi (help·info)) (22
                                December 1853 – 20 July 1920), born Kshemankari/ Thakurmani/ Saradamani Mukhopadhyay,
                                was the wife and spiritual consort of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, a nineteenth-century
                                Hindu mystic. Sarada Devi is also reverentially addressed as the Holy Mother (Sri Sri
                                Maa) by the followers of the Sri Ramakrishna monastic order. The Sri Sarada Math and
                                Ramakrishna Sarada Mission situated at Dakshineshwar is based on the ideals and life of
                                Sarada Devi. She played an important role in the growth of the Ramakrishna Movement.

                                Sarada Devi was born in Joyrambati, a village in present-day Bankura District in the
                                state of West Bengal, India. She was married to Ramakrishna in 1859[citation needed]
                                when she was only six years old while Ramakrishna was 23 years old. After the marriage,
                                Sarada mostly stayed at Jayrambati and joined Ramakrishna in Dakshineswar Kali temple at
                                the age of eighteen. According to her biographers, both lived "lives of unbroken
                                continence, showing the ideals of a householder and of the monastic ways of life". After
                                Ramakrishna's death, Sarada Devi stayed most of the time either at Joyrambati or at the
                                Udbodhan office, Calcutta. The disciples of Ramakrishna regarded her as their own
                                mother, and after their guru's death looked to her for advice and encouragement. The
                                followers of the Ramakrishna movement and a large section of devotees across the world
                                worship Sarada Devi as an incarnation of the Adi Parashakti or the Divine Mother.
